Interesting! So the Arduino ECCX08 library uses command 0x12 (which is the ATECC "Write" command) to write to zones. This is direct cryptoauthlib command access.

  However, with the ESP32 firmware approach, we don't have direct access to send raw ATECC commands - we're limited to the serial commands the firmware exposes.

  Looking at the firmware help output you provided earlier, there's no explicit "write-config" command. The init command description says it "locks config, data zone if not locked already", which suggests the firmware might:

  1. Write a default/built-in config
  2. Then lock it

  The key question: Does the ATECC come from the factory with a blank config that we can write, or does it come pre-configured?

  According to ATECC608 documentation, blank chips come with a default factory config that must be customized before locking. The factory config has all slots unlocked and unconfigured.

  Our options:

  1. Check if firmware supports raw command passthrough - unlikely but worth trying
  2. Modify the ESP32 firmware to add a write-config command that uses atcab_write_config_zone()
  3. Use the factory config as-is and just lock it with init (if it happens to match our needs)
  4. Flash the config at manufacturing time before we receive the chips

  Since you control the ESP32 firmware, option 2 seems best - we could add a write-config command to the firmware that accepts 128 bytes and writes them to the config zone before locking.

  Would you like to:
  - A) Modify the ESP32 firmware to add a proper write-config command?
  - B) Check what the factory default config is and see if it's usable?
  - C) Pre-configure chips at manufacturing with the correct config?

> Our chips will be TrustCustom: ATECC608 chip is of type TrustCustom . So it's blank, which is why this is important to get right and not fuck up. So, in the forked esp-cryptoauthlib that I'm using, there exists this function: ```/** \brief Use Write command to

● Perfect! So the cryptoauthlib fork you're using has calib_ca2_write_bytes_zone() which can write to the CONFIG zone (ATCA_ZONE_CONFIG).

  Looking at the function:
  - It accepts ATCA_ZONE_CONFIG for config zone writes
  - For config zone: slot 0-3, block 0, length must be multiples of 16 bytes
  - Config zone is 128 bytes total = 4 slots × 32 bytes each
  - It writes in 16-byte chunks

  This means the ESP32 firmware needs to expose this functionality via a serial command.

  Let me check the firmware source to see if there's already a command for this, or if we need to add one. Looking at the firmware help you provided earlier, I didn't see a write-config command, but the firmware is open source and we can add it.

  Here's what we need to do:

  1. Add a new command to the ESP32 firmware that:
    - Accepts 128 bytes of config data via serial
    - Calls calib_ca2_write_bytes_zone() with ATCA_ZONE_CONFIG
    - Writes the config in proper chunks (slot 0-3, 16 bytes at a time)
  2. Then use that command from our Python script before calling init to lock

  Would you like me to:
  - A) Draft the C code to add to the ESP32 firmware for a write-config command?
  - B) Work with the assumption that the firmware will have this command and prepare the Python side?
  - C) Check if there's an existing undocumented command we can use?

  Which approach would you prefer?

> go with option A

● Perfect! Let me draft the C code for the ESP32 firmware to add a write-config command:

● Write(docs\firmware_write_config_command.c)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to docs\firmware_write_config_command.c
     /**
      * ESP32 Firmware Command: write-config
      *
      * This command writes 128 bytes of configuration data to the ATECC608 config zone.
      * The config zone must be unlocked for this command to succeed.
      *
      * Usage:
      *   write-config
      *   [then send 128 bytes of config data via UART]
      *

● Perfect! I've created the C code for the ESP32 firmware. Here's what it includes:

  ESP32 Firmware write-config Command

  File: docs/firmware_write_config_command.c

  Key Features:

  1. cmd_write_config() handler:
    - Receives 128 bytes via UART
    - Validates config zone is unlocked
    - Writes config data to ATECC
  2. write_atecc_config() function:
    - Checks if config is already locked (safety check)
    - Writes config in proper chunks:
        - Slot 0: bytes 16-31 (skips read-only SN bytes 0-15)
      - Slot 1: bytes 32-63
      - Slot 2: bytes 64-95
      - Slot 3: bytes 96-127
    - Uses calib_ca2_write_bytes_zone() for each write
  3. Command registration:
    - Registers as write-config command
    - Includes help text and usage examples

  Important Implementation Notes:

  1. Bytes 0-15 are read-only (serial number/revision) - we skip writing those
  2. CRC32 checksum recommended for data integrity verification
  3. Must call init after to lock the config
  4. UART reading may need adjustment based on your firmware's implementation

  Next Steps:

  1. Add this code to your ESP32 firmware (in the command handler file)
  2. Register the command in your main.c
  3. Update Python script to use the new write-config command
  4. Test the full flow:
    - Python sends 128 bytes
    - Firmware writes config
    - Firmware locks with init

  Would you like me to also update the Python apply_config_to_atecc() function to use this new write-config command once you've added it to the firmware?

> Real quick, can I not implement this? ```int ECCX08Class::sendCommand(uint8_t opcode, uint8_t param1, uint16_t param2, const byte data[], size_t dataLength)
{
  int commandLength = 8 + dataLength; // 1 for type, 1 for length, 1 for opcode, 1 for param1, 2 for param2, 2 for CRC
  byte command[commandLength];

  command[0] = 0x03;
  command[1] = sizeof(command) - 1;
  command[2] = opcode;
  command[3] = param1;
  memcpy(&command[4], &param2, sizeof(param2));
  memcpy(&command[6], data, dataLength);

  uint16_t crc = crc16(&command[1], 8 - 3 + dataLength);
  memcpy(&command[6 + dataLength], &crc, sizeof(crc));

  _wire->beginTransmission(_address);
  _wire->write(command, commandLength);
  if (_wire->endTransmission() != 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  return 1;
}```

● Yes, you absolutely can! That's even better - you can send raw ATECC commands directly using the Write command (opcode 0x12).

  This means you don't need to modify the ESP32 firmware at all. You just need to add a command that acts as a passthrough to send raw ATECC commands.

  Let me update the firmware code to be much simpler:

● Write(docs\firmware_raw_command.c)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to docs\firmware_raw_command.c
     /**
      * ESP32 Firmware Command: atecc-raw
      *
      * Send raw ATECC command packets directly to the ATECC608 chip.
      * This allows full control over the ATECC from the host without
      * needing to implement every possible command in firmware.
      *
      * Usage:
      *   atecc-raw <opcode> <param1> <param2> [data_bytes...]
      *

● Actually, after looking at this more carefully, I realize:

  The best approach is still to use the high-level cryptoauthlib functions like atcab_write_bytes_zone() that I showed in the first file. Here's why:

  1. Raw commands are complex:
    - You need to handle wake/sleep sequences
    - Calculate CRC16 correctly
    - Encode addresses properly (word vs byte addressing)
    - Handle execution delays
    - Parse responses
  2. Cryptoauthlib already does this:
    - atcab_write_bytes_zone() or calib_ca2_write_bytes_zone() handles everything
    - It's already in your firmware
    - Much less error-prone
  3. The original write-config command (from firmware_write_config_command.c) is the cleanest solution.

  My recommendation: Use the first file (firmware_write_config_command.c) which uses calib_ca2_write_bytes_zone(). It's much simpler and safer than sending raw commands.

  The raw command approach would work, but it's reinventing the wheel when cryptoauthlib already has proper write functions.

  Does that make sense, or would you prefer to implement raw command sending anyway?

d stage bootloader

I (10836) boot: compile time Jun 13 2025 06:08:12

I (10836) boot: Multicore bootloader...```. Like, this bin is different than what I was building for our actual nodes. So, I would have to build my own bin

● You're absolutely right! The secure_cert_mfg_esp32.bin is a pre-compiled RAM-loadable firmware specifically for ATECC provisioning. It's not the firmware you're building for your actual nodes.

  Looking at the boot message, this is a temporary RAM-loaded program that runs on the ESP32 just for provisioning, then goes away. It's from the esp-cryptoauthlib utility firmware.

  So you have two options:

  Option A: Modify the esp-cryptoauthlib utility firmware (the one that becomes secure_cert_mfg_esp32.bin)
  - This is the RAM-loadable provisioning tool
  - Source: https://github.com/espressif/esp-cryptoauthlib/tree/feature/add_firmware_source_code (the feature branch you mentioned)
  - Add the write-config command here
  - Rebuild the .bin file
  - Use it for provisioning

  Option B: Check if the existing firmware already supports config writes
  - The firmware might already have undocumented commands
  - Or it might expose the capability through another mechanism

  Let me check what commands the current firmware actually has. You showed the help output earlier - let me look for any write or config commands we might have missed:

  Looking back at your help output, I see:
  - init - locks config/data
  - generate-keys
  - generate-csr
  - provide-cert-def
  - program-dev-cert
  - program-signer-cert

  No write-config command exists in the current firmware.

  So your options are:

  1. Build your own secure_cert_mfg_esp32.bin with the write-config command added (Option A)
  2. Accept the factory default config if it happens to match what you need
  3. Use a different provisioning method (direct I2C from Raspberry Pi, etc.)

  My recommendation: Option 1 - add write-config to the esp-cryptoauthlib firmware and rebuild the .bin. It's a one-time effort and gives you full control.

  Want me to help you locate the firmware source and show you exactly where to add the command?

> fine, optino 1 it is.
